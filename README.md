Anti-Cheating Mechanism Development

Real-Time Eye Tracking: Developed a system to detect and monitor eye movements in real-time using MediaPipe Face Mesh, ensuring robust performance across varied conditions.

Facial Landmark Detection: Implemented detection of facial landmarks on images and video streams, focusing on eyes and irises, within a cloud-based environment using Google Colab.

Visualization and Annotation: Enhanced image outputs by drawing and annotating facial landmarks with OpenCV, optimizing for clarity and accuracy in visual representation.
